# WebsiteDesign
First front-end project! 

Use HTML and CSS flexbox to position elements. 

Use Javascript to implement below conditions: 

Checkboxes and levers are disabled until "TrustNo1" (excluding the quotation marks) is entered into the password field and submitted with the ok button. 

All checkboxes must be ticked and levers must be at maximum position to enable the launch button. 


Following all these steps and clicking launch button will set the rocket to launch!
